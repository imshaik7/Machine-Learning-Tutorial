This repository contains a complete tutorial and implementation on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** as part of the coursework for the *Machine Learning and Neural Networks* module. The project demonstrates the theoretical foundation, practical implementation, and performance evaluation of SVMs using different kernel functions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Support Vector Machines are a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. This tutorial aims to:

- Understand the SVM decision function and margin maximization.
- Explore kernel methods: Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid.
- Apply SVMs to synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Visualize decision boundaries for different kernels.
- Compare SVM with other models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- Analyze model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
